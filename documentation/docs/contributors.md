Building this cold storage solution involved many people. Engineers from various teams within Square generously
contributed time and energy to review the initial design. They then helped write and review the code.

A cross-function group of people were involved to build the physical locations, implement the design, write the
coordinator service, test the solution and iterate on bug fixes.

In addition to the list below, a number of people asked to remain anonymous.
